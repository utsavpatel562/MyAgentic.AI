```env
# Get from your Neon database project settings
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_connection_string"

# BetterAuth Keys
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_better_auth_secret"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="better_auth_url"

# Get from GitHub OAuth App settings
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your_github_client_id"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your_github_client_secret"

# Get from Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 Client ID settings
